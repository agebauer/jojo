Cloud Secure collects device data using one or more agents. Agents connect to devices in your environment and collect data that is sent to the Cloud Secure SaaS layer for analysis. 

.Before you begin

* The Docker CE package must be installed on the VM hosting the agent. 
** RHEL and CentOS agent systems should always have the Docker CE package installed. Users should not install the Docker-client-xx or Docker-common-xx native RHEL Docker packages since these do not support the 'docker run cli format' that Cloud Secure supports. 
* OpenJDK Java is required. 
* The IBM Java package, found in some RHEL versions, must be uninstalled. 
* The 'sudo su â€“' command is required for installation, running scripts, and uninstall.  

.Steps for Installation 

. Log in as Administrator or Account Owner to your Cloud  Secure environment. 
. Click *Admin > Data Collectors > Agents > +Agent*
+
